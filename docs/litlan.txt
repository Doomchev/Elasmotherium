My number is random number from 0 to 99.
Let's start. Tell me what number did I guess.
If number is more than my number then I'll say "Your number is more than mine!" and will go to start.
If number is less than my number then I'll say "Your number is less than mine!" and will go to start.
I'll say "You're right!"

I'll ask you "Enter number".
I'll say "Factorial of number is Fatorial for number.".
Factorial for number is 1 if number less or equal to 1 or factorial for number -1 else.
